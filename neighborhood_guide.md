## Neighborhoods

![seattle neighborhoods](seattle-neighborhood-map.jpg "Seattle Neighborhoods")

### Pioneer Square

_Street addresses: no directional._

The oldest neighborhood in Seattle! There are sometimes cheap studios and one bedrooms here, but more are getting renovated into expensive loft-like spaces. This is close to the football and baseball stadiums, so sometimes traffic can be bad, and if you have a car and no dedicated parking that can be a big problem. Several of the homeless shelters/missions are in this area, so there are quite a lot of homeless people around. It is just south of downtown, so walking to class is definitely doable. Also, there's no real grocery store in the neighborhood.

### International District (ID) / Chinatown

_Street addresses: sometimes no directional & sometimes S._

It is right next to Pioneer Square, and there is not a super clear line of deliniation between the two neighborhoods, so a lot of the commentary about Pioneer Square applies here. As the name implies, it is an eclectic neighborhood, and there is a lot of really delicious, fairly affordable places to eat, including chinese, vietnamese and korean restaurants. The further west (away from downtown) you go in the ID the more residential it becomes. Main grocery stores are asian markets (like Uwajimaya & Viet Wah).

### South Lake Union (SLU)

_Street addresses: no directional (below Denny) & N (past Denny)._

Home of Amazon. Bro-town. Not a super pedestrian friendly area, and though more retail and restaurants are popping up, it doesn't feel like much of a neighborhood. A lot of the housing in this area is both really nice and really expensive, as Amazonians who want to live close to work have the salaries to afford some really nice places, and it is very central and close to downtown. Traffic can sometimes be a nightmare here because there are only a few arterial streets (it is sandwiched between I-5 and Highway 99) and consistent construction. A lot of the buildings do have roof decks, which can be awesome for fourth of July fireworks displays on Lake Union and New Year's fireworks from the Space Needle. Make friends with people who live here so you can hang out on their roofs and boats ;-)

### Belltown

_Street addresses: no directional._

Right next to downtown Seattle, so it's wonderfully located. Lots of restaurants, bars, shops and very walkable. Mostly flat, unlike other neighborhoods. It can get a bit rowdy, especially on weekend nights. Most of the housing in this area is in tall apartment buildings, and it is going to be one of the more expensive areas to live, though every once and a while something reasonable will come up.

### Lower Queen Anne

_Street addresses: W & N._

Quieter more chill area of Seattle, that's a little more pricey. Located right by Seattle Center (home of EMP Museum and the Space Needle). Parking/traffic can be rough in this area because of all the events at the Seattle center, but it is a nice central place to live and sometimes you can find studios or one bedrooms in this area in slightly older buildings which can make it more affordable.

### First Hill

_Street addresses: no directional & E._

Used to also be referred to as pill hill, because there are a lot of hospitals in the area. If you are easily awoken by ambulance sirens, it may not be the best place to live. The location is very convenient as it is close to downtown and to Capitol Hill, but there is not often a ton of open housing in the area. There are a few new complexes under construction in the area but will likely be pretty pricey when they open, and there is at least one microhousing building in the neighborhood.

### Capitol Hill

_Street addresses: E, the occasional no directional below Broadway._

Known as the most LGBT-friendly neighborhood. Tons of cool shops and restaurants. Likely to be a bit obnoxious on weekend nights. Very expensive in terms of housing. Expect to pay about $2000/month for a one bedroom apartment. Hard to find parking and if your building has a parking lot or garage, expect to pay more for it. A good neighborhood for someone who likes to be right in the middle of it all.

### Central District

_Street addresses: S & E, depending on which way a street runs (S for north-south streets, E for east-west)._

This is one of the first neighborhoods at the top of the hill around downtown, so there is more residential and sometimes cheaper housing available. It is extremely bikable to downtown, especially on the way into class, and is generally quieter on evenings andweekends than neighborhoods with more of a night life. There are a few cute neighborhood bars and good coffee shops though, like Chucks Hop Shop CD, Neighbor Lady, Twilight Exit, and Cortona Cafe.

### University District (U-District)

_Street addresses: NE._

This is where the University of Washington is located, so there are a lot of rental properties in this area. Expect to find a lot of students in this neighborhood, which can be both good and bad-- kind of depends on how you feel about large numbers of 18-22 year olds. There are a lot of cheap, fast places to eat and coffee shops that are open late. It is a good place to look for sublets, but realize that your housemates may be college students and it is hard (aka stressful) to move during Ada. It has accessible transit to downtown, but it is a bit further away than some neighborhoods and is a somewhat hilly bike commute. In 2016, the light rail will connect through Capitol Hill (Broadway & John) to the Montlake side of the U District.

U District is  an excellent location for thrift shopping, since Buffalo Exchange, Goodwill, and Red Light Vintage run along The Ave. If you're on a budget, this is a great area to look for seasonal clothes, since many UW students leave like-new belongings behind!

### Fremont

_Street addresses: NW._

Fremont is the self-coined Center of the Universe, and can be a fun place to live if you can find housing-- it often is sparse and expensive. It is the location of the solstice parade (which includes a naked bike ride) and is home to many bars, restaurants, breweries and tap rooms. It is north of Queen Anne from downtown, or west of Wallingford on the north side of Lake Union. From downtown, there is a bridge that is low enough it has to open for boat traffic, so that can cause some traffic problems from time to time. It is on the Burke Gilman trail (fun bike ride) and it not too terrible of a bike commute to downtown (but again, hills, because Seattle).

### Ballard

_Street addresses: NW._

Ballard is kind of new hipster central in Seattle, with new craft cocktail gastropubs and microbreweries seemingly popping up weekly. It is a pretty fun place to go out on the weekends and they have an awesome Sunday farmer's market. There is quite a bit of new construction, but it is pretty pricey given it is brand new.

Getting downtown via transit isn't impossible, but because it is further west, it can make getting to some internships inconvenient at times. It would not be very convenient to commute to an Eastside (Bellevue, Kirkland, Redmond) internship or job. If you are already coming from an hour plus commute, this might not be an issue for you.

### South Seattle AKA West Seattle, White Center, Beacon Hill, Mount Baker, Columbia City

_Street addresses: SW, S._

People often think of these neighborhoods as being really far away, but with public transit you can get to downtown in 10-25 minutes. South Seattle in general is awesome if you love having fruit & vegetable markets, a ton of halal and asian corner markets, and access to the cheaper grocery chains like Safeway. For West Seattle, buses run fairly frequently and late. For the rest of South Seattle, there's the light rail on top of the regular & late-running buses. That being said, make sure you are __close__ to a downtown route. Connections can break your commute and neighborhood buses tend to run less frequently.

### West Seattle

_Street addresses: SW._

It has a great retail area, Alki beach (the peninsula that looks back toward downtown), great parks, a nice farmer's market, good grocery options, and more housing than cap/first hill. Some people say that people who live in West Seattle don't leave unless they have to-- it is definitely a distinctive community. There is also a water taxi to downtown from the east side of Alki, but it doesn't run that frequently or year round, so it is more of a fun adventure than a regular commuting option.

### Beacon Hill

_Street addresses: S._

Beacon hill is a great neighborhood with an excellent community center, its very own library, and a great view of the old Amazon building on the way back home. Like most neighbohoods, it has a few clusters of magical shops and bars and restaurants and some great community events.

### Columbia City & Mount Baker

_Street addresses: S._

These neighborhoods rock but are a bit far from the action of downtown. A lot of the older restaurants, bars, and corner stores are still intact in these neighborhoods, and there are a ton of large grocery stores and markets. Columbia City has a fantastic farmers market and a short, fairly recently gentrified strip of restaurants and bars. Alas, the magical greek restaurant & laundromat has shut down.
