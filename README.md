Ada Guide for Transplants
=========================
Congratulations and welcome to Ada Developers Academy! This guide was written by a few transplants of Ada Cohort 3. We thought it would have been nice to have an orientation packet to help us move from our current homes to Seattle, so here it is. First of all, this is a huge step and while it may seem scary, try not to fret. You have a lots of supporters at Ada Developers Academy and hopefully this guide will help you get started. If you'd like more personal help or to chat one on one, feel free to contact any of the people listed at the bottom of the guide. We're here to help!

## Misconceptions About Seattle
- **Rain**  
There are plenty of places that get just as much, if not more rain than Seattle (i.e. states bordering the gulf). If anything, it can be overcast a lot of the time. When it does rain, it's more of a continous drizzle. And during the summer it is quite dry and nice. You can read more about our weather in this local TV station's [great Seattle weather FAQ](http://www.komonews.com/weather/faq/).
- **[Seattle Freeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Freeze)**  
You're moving here with 23 built-in friends!! Then you'll meet their friends, and they'll meet you – even more friends! Outside of that, like anywhere else, it depends on the person. Once you're in your internship, you'll have more free time and it'll be much easier to do activities outside of Ada (and meet new people). Generally, people in Seattle can be pretty friendly.
- **Seattle loves adventure**  
Not necessarily a misconception, but something you might not expect from a tech town. Whether it be hiking, camping, kayaking, climbing… Seattle has it all and people love to be outside*. * During the summer months (hey – something to look forward to!). If you hate the crowds or don't mind a little rain, you can do all these things year round.



## Housing
**My Lease Doesn’t Begin Until After I Arrive… Am I Homeless?**  
Nah, girl! We wouldn’t leave you stranded like that. If you find yourself in such a situation, feel free to contact any of the names listed at the bottom of the guide and we'll try to find a place for you to crash. Ada will likely have some volunteers from past cohorts who are willing to house you while you look/wait for housing. Be clear about whether you’re bringing a pet or are a smoker, since it might violate the terms of their lease. And don’t forget to thank your host before moving into your new place!

**Seattle's 20 Day Notification**  
Apartment renters are required to notify their landlords of their departure from the apartment 20 days prior to actually vacating. This means that the apartments that show up for rent (especially the good ones) are not on the market for very long. Many times, landlords will have open houses for the vacant apartment.

**[Microapartments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microapartment)**  
A microapartment is a furnished, one-room, living space (kind of like a dorm room). There are two companies that provide micro-housing: [Footprint](http://liveatfootprint.com/) (who allow pets) and [Apodments](http://apodment.com/) (who don't). That's really their biggest difference. The studio apartments typically come furnished with a twin bed, a mini fridge, a microwave and maybe a few pieces of furniture. Both companies offer a commons lounge with a full range stove and often times a laundry room inside the building. They're great if you're particular about where you want to live in Seattle but don't have the moolah for a studio/1 bedroom. Also, they're relatively the same and brand spanking new so there's (usually) no worries about signing a lease without seeing the place. They typically range in price from $750 up to $1000+ a month depending on the size and shared spaces. Crockpots and stovetop burners are _highly_ recommended if you're the cooking type.

**Rent Pricing**  
[A Week of Mining Seattle's Craigslist Apartment Pricing](http://www.racketracer.com/2014/12/23/a-week-of-seattles-craigslist-apartment-pricing/) This article provides an equation to calculate how much one can expect to pay each month. Using this, you can determine the expected rental price in each neighborhood based on the number of rooms and square footage of the apartment. See below for an example calculation based on the article.

**Expected Rental Price Equation**  
  SQFT = square footage in hundreds  
  BATH = # of bathrooms  
  BED = # of bedrooms

  RENT = Base Price of neighborhood ($X) + (SQFT * 69.68) + (BATH * 322) + (BED * 107)

  For example, a 500sqft. 1bdr/1bath apartment in U-District would be approx.
  $1368.40 = Base Price of U-District (591) + (5 * 69.68) + (1 * 322) + (1 * 107)

_Neighborhoods in Order from Most Expensive to Least Expensive_:
- Downtown
- Belltown
- Capitol Hill
- South Lake Union
- Ballard
- First Hill
- Ballard
- Fremont/Wallingford
- Pioneer Square/ID
- Queen Anne
- Madison Park/Montlake
- University District - most expensive in late summer and fall
- Greenlake / Ravenna / Wedgewood / Bryant / View Ridge
- Central District
- Magnolia
- West Seattle
- Beacon Hill
- Columbia City
- Greenwood/Crown Hill

**Expected Rental Price Equation**  
  SQFT = square footage in hundreds  
  BATH = # of bathrooms  
  BED = # of bedrooms

  RENT = Base Price of neighborhood ($X) + (SQFT * 69.68) + (BATH * 322) + (BED * 107)

  For example, a 500sqft. 1bdr/1bath apartment in U-District would be approx.  
  $1368.40 = Base Price of U-District (591) + (5 * 69.68) + (1 * 322) + (1 * 107)

If you can't come to Seattle to see the place yourself, ask the landlord to take pictures, send you a video tour or even walk you around via Skype. If you explain your situation some are understanding and willing to accomodate. Otherwise, some current Adies may be willing to go look at a place for you.

**Housemates**  
If you don't mind living with strangers / roommmates, craigslist is where most people in Seattle post looking for housemates. This method of apartment hunting is really better done in person, both for your own protection and because a lot of housemates won't rent to someone they haven't met in person. At the very least, skype with a potential housemate and have them walk around the space. Be wary of sending money before seeing the space in person.

If you have a place you can crash for about a week, you should be able to find something. But watch out-- good places go quickly! Come prepared with all the details you'll need to fill out housing applications. If you really like a place and can find the application online, you can get a step ahead of other applicants by bringing your already filled out application with you.

Roommates are usually a lot cheaper than solo living on a monetary scale, but only embark on this kind of housing search if you feel comfortable. The place you live while attending Ada needs to feel safe and drama-free, so you can relax from the stress of 40 to 60 hours a week intensively studying.

## Neighborhoods

[Check out the neighborhood guide for a brief overview of Seattle's neighborhoods](/neighborhood_guide.md)

## Getting to Seattle

**Flying**  
So you plan on flying here...see - [Getting Your Things to Seattle](#getting-your-things-to-seattle)

**Driving**  
Two options to get your car here:
  - _Shipping_: on average will cost ~ $1000, not to mention shipping costs for all your stuff, your plane ticket, etc. So.. honestly, why even bother?
  - _Driving_: if you can, buy what you need when you get here so you can stuff your car with bare necessities and call it a day. If that doesn't work for you, renting a small UHaul trailer is a couple hundred, depending on how much space you need.

**Parking**  
If you've never lived in a big city, you may not know...having a car is VERY EXPENSIVE (especially in downtown Seattle)!! Many places have their own garages but charge upwards of $200/month for parking. If you opt to not park in the building garage, the choices outside of that are scarce and/or just as expensive. Seattle public transit is pretty good. Use it.



## Getting Your Things to Seattle
There are several ways to get your things to Seattle. These are some of the methods the transplants from Cohort 3 used:

- Ship boxes to yourself via: [USPS](https://www.usps.com/ship/welcome.htm), [UPS](http://www.ups.com/content/us/en/shipping), [FedEx](http://www.fedex.com/us/ship), [Amtrak](http://www.amtrak.com/express-shipping)
- Shipping a bike: [shipBikes.com](http://www.shipbikes.com)
- Luggage: usually $25 for each checked bag on airlines, limit of 50lbs. per bag
- Moving companies (none of the cohort 3 adies used this method, if you find a good deal, let us know!)
- Driving: pack what you can into your car

Be wary that shipping lots of boxes will cost a lot. This is one of the greatest if not the greatest expense when moving. Often times you'll find that the cost to ship heavier items such as furniture just isn't worth it. Some of the transplants planned an IKEA trip together to buy furniture in our first week in Seattle. If you plan to rent a microapartment, they will come prefurnished with certain furniture. If not, keep this in mind and plan to have the necessities with you when you arrive in Seattle.



## Things You May Need
Seattle’s weather and terrain may be different than your home’s so make sure to include the following in your luggage:

- **Rain Jacket(s)**  
  On the other hand, great brand name ones can be thrifted right here in Seattle.

- **Comfortable Shoes**  
  Get ready to climb those hills! If you plan on walking as your main means of transport, rain boots might not be a bad idea either!

- **A Bike?**  
  Maybe reconsider bringing your car. Parking is tough and can get really expensive. Plus, Seattle is relatively bike friendly. Read our [getting around](#getting-around) and [biking in Seattle](/car_to_bike.md) advice.

- **Your Passport**  
  Vancouver is _right_ there. Who knows! (Other legal documents, e.g. your birth certificate, could come in handy later, too.)



## Buying a Laptop

**Student discount**  
Note that if you're still in college, you have access to the student discounts. It's worth checking out how much the computers cost on campus, since they sometimes will sell the older versions and will cost a bit less. Additionally, on Apple's website, you can shop with the student discount. Be sure to compare the cost of these to the regularly-priced computers -- sometimes it'll save you money, and sometimes it won't.

**Apple discount**  
If you know someone who works at Apple, you might be able to ask them to buy the computer for you. Be careful to only ask someone if they're very close to you, and be understanding if they say no. You don't want to put anyone in an awkward situation. Some people are not comfortable with using their discounts for friends.

**Macbook Pro vs Macbook Air**  
The Air is good enough for what you need in class, but if you plan to use the computer forever, it can be nice to get the Pro. These tend to have more RAM, and let you upgrade the RAM even further, so they won't seem as slow in a couple of years. That being said, it's highly recommended to upgrade the RAM if you can afford it (again, this won't matter as much in Ada but you'll appreciate it down the road). Do what makes the most sense for your budget.

**WA Sales Tax**  
Seattle has a hefty sales tax, 9.6%, offset by the fact that it doesn't have income tax. If you live in an area with lower sales tax, consider buying your laptop BEFORE you arrive in Seattle to save a little bit of money.

**Warranties**  
These computers are pricey enough that you don't want to be out all that money if something goes wrong, and they're really expensive to fix. Check out the warranties you can buy through Apple, as well as other warranties such as [SquareTrade](http://www.squaretrade.com/). Note that some credit cards also have warranties if you buy the computer with the card -- you'll have to look into your card terms and/or call your credit card company. Be sure to ask about what is covered and what isn't.

If you decide to save a little money and not get a brand spanking new laptop, check out these [refurbished machines from Apple](http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/specialdeals/mac).



## Getting Around

**Walking**  
  Don't be afraid to walk for transportation, if you live close enough. It might be a good idea to avoid heels until you get used to the hills and your feet adjust, but lots of Adies walk to class. Google Maps gives good estimates of how long it should take you to walk -- but don't forget to reverse the directions (e.g. look at how long it takes to walk _to_ Ada, and then hit reverse to see how long it takes to walk home _from_ Ada). The hills make the different directions take different times, and Google Maps accounts for this.

**Public Transit**  
  Rapidrides and Link Light Rail are _strongly recommended_ over neighborhood buses due to frequency, hours, and unlikelihood of being affected by the [Great Restructuring of 2016][restructure]. (If you're considering a long commute, rest assured that routes between cities are unlikely to be affected by the restructure.)

[restructure]: http://metro.kingcounty.gov/programs-projects/link-connections/


**[ORCA LIFT](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/programs-projects/orca-lift/)**  
  So... you’re poor! Since it’s likely you’ll have zero income while attending Ada, it’s nice to know there are some perks with falling below the poverty line. The first of few is reduced bus & light rail fare! Regular fare is $2.50 for each ride and $2.75 during peak hours, however, with an ORCA LIFT pass, all rides are $1.50. To apply for a reduced fare pass (the ORCA LIFT card), you’ll need to stop by one of these enrollment offices and provide proof of your eligibility and your identity.

  [You can read more about signing up for ORCA LIFT in the transit guide.][orcalift]

  [orcalift]: /public_transit.md

**Bus Apps**  
  There are a couple of apps that can tell you which buses to take to get home.
  - _OneBusAway_: Arguably the best bus app available in Seattle. Locate your bus stop on the map and this app will tell you roughly when the bus will arrive. Used in conjunction with Google maps, this is a fantastic way to know when you should expect your bus to make it's stop and how to get around.
  - _Google Maps_: Just like you would use this for driving or walking around, Google Maps will tell you which routes to take to get to your destination. Use this in conjunction with OneBusAway for optimum bus trip planning.
  - _TripPlanner_: This app exists and isn't so great. It's made by the county and should be more helpful. Stick with OneBusAway and Google Maps.

**The Link**  
  The Link is awesome! It is the most direct form of public transit from the airport to Seattle and it's surrounding neighborhoods. Currently it's route is limited but is going through the process of expanding to other neighborhoods (expected to finish in 2016). It has right-of-way during peak hours, which means the train sends a signal ahead and the lights change to stop cars at intersections ahead of the train. It also runs every 7 minutes during peak, and that time will reduce to every 5 minutes in the spring or summer when the extension to the U-District is officially open.

**Biking**  
  If you're new to Seattle, here's a warning: the hills are no joke. The thing about the hills is that there aren't a bunch of little hills.... it's that Seattle itself can seem like one GIANT hill. Depending on where you live, it can be a good 30 minute ride uphill the entire way. (It makes getting _to_ Ada easy, though!)

  That being said, it's not a huge deal as long as you don't have a fixed-gear bike and as long as you shift down. Don't sprint up the hills. Take your time. And don't feel silly if you get off and walk for a particularly steep block or two. Lots of people do it. Read our [biking in Seattle](/car_to_bike.md) advice.

**The Ferry**  
  We _strongly_ recommend not living far enough away that you need to take the ferry, simply because commuting takes so much time. That being said, the ferry is a smooth ride and often offers wifi during peak morning hours, so if you're wondering if you can work while you're on the ferry, the answer is yes.

**Driving**  
  We recommend leaving your car at home and not needing to drive. Take a look at the driving section of [Getting to Seattle](#how-we-got-to-seattle) for more info.



## Healthcare

If you're in need of healthcare coverage, once moved to Seattle you can sign up for Washington Apple Health -- Medicaid. You'll need the following information to apply:

- Your household monthly income.
- The Social Security numbers and dates of birth for each member of your household.
- Your immigration information, if that applies to you.

You can apply online OR in person. Signing up for Apple Health can be done in conjunction with getting an OrcaLift card so that you don't have to make multiple trips. Additionally, qualifying for Apple Health will automatically qualify you for the OrcaLift card (See the [Getting Around](#getting-around) section for more information on OrcaLift). The cost of Apple Health is FREE and as an unemployed student of Ada Developers Academy you should qualify. Apple Health coverage includes family doctor visits, preventative care, and prescription medication among other things. Coverage may vary depending on the plan you select when you sign up. You can read up on the individual plans and Apple Health at the links below.

- Apply: [Washington Health Plan Finder](http://www.wahealthplanfinder.org) _Note: site is often down on the weekends for maintenance_
  - Create an account to apply for Apple Health



## Bringing a Pet

Think twice. Ada is a full-time commitment and you’ll likely stay after class to finish writing a program, will want to hang out for happy hour or attend a meet-up. Expect to be home just enough to eat and sleep (you’ll have more time than that, but it’s smart not to count on it). Dogs will need more attention than you might have, so consider the well-being of your pet. Cats, birds, fish, etc. will be more forgiving that you’re not home at least eight hours a day.

If you don't think your pet will be happy living with you while you're in Ada but you don't want to part with him/her, consider asking a friend or family member to take care of your pet until you're in a better position to give them the love that they deserve. Be sure to discuss expenses, though -- who will pay for the pet's food, vet bills, etc.

If you do decide to bring your pet, [we have some information about bringing your pet here][pet].

[pet]: /bringing_a_pet.md


## When You Get Here
I'm in Seattle. NOW WHAT? Get settled, girl! Consider planning an IKEA trip with your other cohort transplants to get some furniture in your new space. Explore your neighborhood and get familiar. Walking around is the best way. And don’t forget to do these easy-to-forget-but-totally-necessary things:

  - **Change your mailing address!**  
    USPS will charge you $1.50 to change your mailing address online, but it’s so worth it. They’ll forward your mail from your old address for about six months and they’ll also notify those sending you mail that your address has changed to the new address. (Also don’t forget to update your bank/investment info, Netflix account, social media profiles, etc.)

  - **Register to vote!**  
    Since you changed your permanent address, you’ll have to register to vote. Don’t forget to do this! Your vote is important!! You can update your voter registration when you get your new driver's license, too!

  - **Get Internet! Cable! Utilities!**  
    If your building doesn’t handle all your utilities, make sure to set them up ASAP. You don’t want to be left without WiFi for weeks! Your building manager should have a list of companies who provide for your location. The options available in Seattle are Comcast, CenturyLink, Wave, and Condo Internet.

  - **Get a library card**  
    The Seattle Public Library is an amazing public service (the central branch is 11 stories!) with many local branches that may be in your neighborhood. All you need is proof of a local mailing address (bring in a piece of mail or a copy of your lease) and you’ll have access to all the things! Said things include free admission to local museums if you book the tickets through the library system! Totally worth it.

  - **Change your driver's license**  
    By law, you have 30 days to change your driver's license and register your car with WA. But let's be honest, you're going to have a lot on your plate. So unless you happen to have a really nosy neighbor, I wouldn't stress it too much. Just make sure you get it done.

  - **Car registration**  
    Just do it when you change your driver's license.

  - **Garbage**  
    Just an FYI -- Seattle likes to be green and keep the Earth happy. Because of this, it is a legal requirement for people to both recycle and compost in addition to just regularly throwing things away. Recycling is in the blue bin and compost in the green bin. Recycling, regular trash, and compost are all picked up by the waste department. A bonus if you're paying for these utilities: recycling is free & compost is cheaper per square foot / size of container than trash. You're welcome. ;)
